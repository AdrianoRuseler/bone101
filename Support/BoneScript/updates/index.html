     <h1>Software Updates</h1>
     <p>There are multiple ways to run initial software on your board, but
      it is likley that the simplest way to get an update is to create an
      exact replica of a bootable microSD card and boot off of it.  The
      BeagleBone Black Rev C has 4GB of eMMC storage (2GB on previous revisions)
      that can be initialized by
      a program booted off of a microSD card.  If you want to update to the
      latest software image for your board, this is a way to do that.</p>

    <h2 id="update">Update board with latest software</h2>
    <h3>Step #1: Download the latest software image</h3>
    <p>Download the lastest Debian image from <a href="https://beagleboard.org/latest-images">beagleboard.org/latest-images</a>. The "IoT" images provide more free disk space if you don't need to use a graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
    <p><small><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Due to sizing necessities, this download may take 30 minutes or more.</small></p>
    <p>The Debian distribution ships with the boards. The file you download will have an .img.xz extension. This is a compressed sector-by-sector image of the SD card.</p>

    <h3>Step #2: Install SD card programming utility</h3>
    <p>Download and install <a target="_blank" href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a>.</p>

    <p>Some general help on programming SD cards can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles">Ubuntu Image Writer page</a>. 

    <h3>Step #3: Connect SD card to your computer</h3>
    <p>Use your computer's SD slot or a USB adapter to connect the SD card to your computer.</p>

    <h3>Step #4: Write the image to your SD card</h3>
    <p>Use Etcher to write the image to your SD card. Etcher will transparently decompress the image on-the-fly before writing it to the SD card.</p>

    <h3>Step #5: Eject the SD card</h3>
    <p>Eject the newly programmed SD card.</p>

    <h3>Step #6: Boot your board off of the SD card</h3>
    <p>Insert SD card into your (powered-down) board, hold down the USER/BOOT button (if using Black) and apply power, either by the USB cable or 5V adapter.</p>
    <p>If using an original BeagleBone, you are done.</p>
    <p>If using BeagleBone Black and desire to write the image to your on-board eMMC, you'll need to follow the instructions at <a href="http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#Flashing_eMMC">http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#Flashing_eMMC</a>. When the flashing is complete, all 4 USRx LEDs will be steady on or off. The latest Debian flasher images automatically power down the board upon completion.  <em>This can take up to 45 minutes.</em>  Power-down your board, remove the SD card and apply power again to finish.</p>
