     <h1>Software Updates</h1>
     <p>While there are many possible ways to boot your Beagle, every
      BeagleBoard and BeagleBone is capable of booting off an SD (or microSD)
      card. To utilize the latest software from the BeagleBoard.org community,
      it is recommended you program an SD card with the latest image, try it
      out and then commit the image to your on-board flash if your board has
      one and you are happy with the functionality of this new software.</p>
     <p><em>Note that not all of the provided images consume the same amount of
      space. It is important to note the size of the image and the amount of
      space consumed within the image to know if it will fit within the
      space of your SD card and potentially your on-board eMMC flash.</em></p>

    <h2 id="update">Update board with latest software</h2>
    <h3>Step #1: Download the latest software image</h3>
    <p>Download the lastest Debian image from <a href="https://beagleboard.org/latest-images">beagleboard.org/latest-images</a>. The "IoT" images provide more free disk space if you don't need to use a graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
    <p><small><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Due to sizing necessities, this download may take 30 minutes or more.</small></p>
    <p>The Debian distribution ships with the boards. The file you download will have an .img.xz extension. This is a compressed sector-by-sector image of the SD card.</p>

    <h3>Step #2: Install SD card programming utility</h3>
    <p>Download and install <a target="_blank" href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a>.</p>

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/static/images/install-etcher.png" width="50%" /><br />
    <p>Some general help on programming SD cards can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles">Ubuntu Image Writer page</a>. 

    <h3>Step #3: Connect SD card to your computer</h3>
    <p>Use your computer's SD slot or a USB adapter to connect the SD card to your computer.</p>

    <h3>Step #4: Write the image to your SD card</h3>
    <p>Use Etcher to write the image to your SD card. Etcher will transparently decompress the image on-the-fly before writing it to the SD card.</p>

    <h3>Step #5: Eject the SD card</h3>
    <p>Eject the newly programmed SD card.</p>

    <h3>Step #6: Boot your board off of the SD card</h3>
    <p>Insert SD card into your (powered-down) board, hold down the USER/BOOT button (if using Black) and apply power, either by the USB cable or 5V adapter.</p>
    <p>If using an original BeagleBone, you are done.</p>
    <p>If using BeagleBone Black and desire to write the image to your on-board eMMC, you'll need to follow the instructions at <a href="http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#Flashing_eMMC">http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#Flashing_eMMC</a>. When the flashing is complete, all 4 USRx LEDs will be steady on or off. The latest Debian flasher images automatically power down the board upon completion.  <em>This can take up to 45 minutes.</em>  Power-down your board, remove the SD card and apply power again to finish.</p>
